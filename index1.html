        <h1> Mood swing</h1>
        Mood swings are sudden changes in how you feel. They're caused by changing levels of brain chemicals. They can be a regular part of life, like hunger. Or they can be a sign that something else is going on, like adolescence, the transition to menopause or a mood disorder.
